# Edrolo-Autocomplete
## IMPORTANT INFORMATION

The program doesnt guess multiple choice questions correcty, rather it guesses it randomly. For it to actually get questions like it correct, there would need to be some AI implementation in which I haven't done but may consider in the future.
With the written response questions, it will leave a response of "Completed in work book", you can change it to any better excuse that you have
All questions excluding multiple choice will give you the max amount of marks
